# Soon-Rides

<initial planning>

1. Pull data from the rides Google Sheet
    a. Name, phone number, driver + can you give rides, address, fellowship, comments
    
2. Going to Geth
    a. Calculate driver:non-driver ratio â†’ determines whether to print out the warning message
    
    b. A table of:
    - current driver names and the total number
    - current non-driver names and the total number
    - driver:non-driver ratio, warning message
    
3. Coming back from Geth
    a. group people who live in the same area together
    - pre-define the matching group ranks
      e.g. VDCN's rank -> VDCN, VDC, Camino, Plaza, Mesa, Middle Earth, Mesa
      VDCN people together, if needed match them with VDC, if not then Camino, ...
    - manually have to determine the efficiency between apartments smh
   
    b. Once set, get it confirmed by whoever is in charge of rides
    - have a feature for the rides person to manually adjust the rides (like a table)
   
    c. (optional) maayyyybe send the confirmed rides through submitted phone number?
    - check the cost for messaging from web
